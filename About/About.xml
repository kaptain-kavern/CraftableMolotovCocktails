	<description>Just craftable Molotov cocktails, nothing less, nothing more. 

They cost 50 chemfuel units, 50 Cloth units and 50 Beer to produce (at the Crafting Spot or Refinery)

Crafting them requires the research project "Refining" to be finished. And a minimum crafting skills of 3.

The mod also changes the Molotov cocktails label and description a bit.

////////////////////////About the cost////////////////////////

As I don't use them often, at first I had forget that one Molotov cocktail item means unlimited ammo. I had set the price to 5 cloth units and 1 beer but it was way too OP that way. Even now this is too OP, IMHO   

////////////////////////////Thanks////////////////////////////

Came from this suggestion on Reddit :
