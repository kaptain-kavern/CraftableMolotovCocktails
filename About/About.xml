	<description>Just craftable Molotov cocktails, nothing less, nothing more. 

They cost 50 chemfuel, 25 Cloth units and 1 Beer to produce (at the Crafting Spot)




////////////////////////About the cost////////////////////////

As I don't use them often, at first I had forget that one Molotov cocktail item means unlimited ammo. I had set the price to 5 cloth units and 1 beer but it was way too OP that way.

So i looked at the market values :

Molotov's cost 200 silver, Beer 9, Chemfuel 3 and cloth 1.5.

    So I choose 1 beer (=9 silver), 50 units of chemfuel (=150 silver) and 25 cloth units (=37.5 silver) 
    because it roughly make the same price (=196.5 silver)
    and even that way I found it too OP :p
