## About the cost  
As I don't use them often, at first I had forget that one Molotov cocktail item means unlimited ammo. *I had set the price to 5 cloth units and 1 beer but it was way too OP that way.*    

So i looked at the market values :     
>Molotov's cost **200 silver**, Beer **9** and cloth **1.5**.   
So I choose 15 beers (=135 silver) and 40 cloth units (=60 silver) because it roughly make the same price (=195 silver)   
and even that way I found it a bit too OP :p
