## About the cost  
As I don't use them often, at first I had forget that one Molotov cocktail item means unlimited ammo. *I had set the price to 5 cloth units and 1 beer but it was way too OP that way.*    

So i looked at the market values :     

Molotov's cost **200 silver**, Beer **9**, Chemfuel **3** and cloth **1.5**.  

>So I choose 1 beer (=9 silver), 50 units of chemfuel (=150 silver) and 25 cloth units (=37.5 silver) because it roughly make the same price (=196.5 silver)   
and even that way I found it too OP :p
